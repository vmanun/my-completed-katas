# Completed Katas

Hello there! Here I want to leave a compilation of my takes on some katas (if you're unaware of the term, it's basically a coding challenge, provided by the cool users of [Codewars](https://codewars.com)!)

I'll provide the link to the original kata post, along credits from the user that made the premise of it!
